# Computer-vision-projects

In this repository I am sharing my **codes** for all the projects and assignemnts of **the graduate level courses (Intro to computer vision, deep learning and computer vision)** I took during my PhD.

I hope you find it useful! :-)

You can use the link in each project to directly open and run the codes in google colab. Note that you should upload the files provided in the data path of each project.
